# This project is a simulation of self driving car


The files contains a neural network for a reinforced learning and a kivy application so can the user draw the lines that serves as the data for the neural network and the object that we dominate as a car if it passes the line or coordinates of the points that we draw it gots assigned -1 and if it does stay inside the contoures or the lines we assigned +1 and as that our reinforced learning works by doing that and saving the results using a saving point we cant load the result and continue the learning or delete all the data we gathred and start anew.
After several training and time the car (kivy object) will start to stay within the lines drawn by the user as the result of our training start to converge.

## Technologies use:

Kivy
Tensorflow
Keras
