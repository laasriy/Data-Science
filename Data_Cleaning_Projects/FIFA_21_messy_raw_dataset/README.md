This dataset was taken from Kaggle, it was destined for cleaning and exploration as most of the datasets in Kaggle are cleaned then provided for analysis.
 Shoutout to RACHIT TOSHNIWAL for providing this dataset, the data was scraped from the website sofifa.com

## The Cleaning process:

1. Removing The columns that we don't need.
2. Changing the type of columns like Height, Weight, Value, etc. from strings to integers or floats if needed.
3. Adjusting columns like height and weight from feet and pound respectively to cm and kg using universal measures.
4. Removing new line charachters from some columns and stars from some columns.
5. Dividing some joints columns like contract and team to different columns.
6. Droping undesired columns.
