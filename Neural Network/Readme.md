## 🌟 Project Overview
This project is an educational journey through neural network fundamentals, implemented in Python with NumPy. Each notebook progressively builds complexity:

- **NN1**: Single neuron implementation with theoretical knowledge
- **NN2**: Multiple neurons and hidden layers
- **NN3**: Deep neural networks with advanced techniques

All implementations are accompanied by detailed mathematical explanations and visualizations.
