# A Practice Case

A practice Case of data scraped from an e-commerce website of the sales in the website.

**Data :** Directory of the dataset

**Public :** Out√ªt for scripts

**Scripts :** .py (the script) file and the notebook file


**PS 1 :**
The necessary libraries are in the file: 'requierements.txt'

**PS 2:**
You will find the output of the script file in Public/ directory

**Introduction:**
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a data file representing sales lines from a furniture-focused e-commerce site operating on the marketplace model. The unique aspect of this platform is its sale of products from various third-party sellers. Each product is categorized based on its nature and universe, where the universe represents the macro-level (level 1) and nature corresponds to level 2.

**Project Objectives:**

1. Visualization:

Creation of graphs for an overall sales analysis, including temporal evolution, analysis by universe/nature, and analysis by seller.
Proposal of an initial mockup for a data visualization dashboard based on the created graphs.

2. Categorization:

Development of an algorithm to identify and recategorize incorrectly classified lines throughout the dataset. Target categories are defined in the "nature" column, with no authorization to create new categories.
Implementation of an algorithm to extract product dimensions and colors (if mentioned in the description). For example, the algorithm should extract the dimensions of a mattress from the description.

3. Sales & Price Analysis for Mattresses:

Creation of a specific view for analyzing the evolution of sales and prices, focusing on mattresses.
Exploration of factors influencing the volume and evolution of sales for all mattresses or specific products. Proposal of analyses and/or graphs to address this question.



This project aims to provide in-depth insights and clear visualizations to enable a detailed understanding of sales performance on the furniture marketplace platform.
