# Project MeteoFrance
## Project Overview
This project is a data analysis and visualization project focused on meteorological data. The objective is to analyze and visualize various meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, and other related variables. The project employs Python and several libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, and Folium.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key sections:

**Data Collection:** Data is collected from various sources and stored in a structured format for analysis. The data used in this project contains a wide range of meteorological parameters, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover.

**Data Analysis:** The data is analyzed to identify patterns, relationships, and trends within the meteorological parameters. Various statistical methods, including linear regression and hypothesis tests, are employed to gain insights from the data.

**Data Visualization:** Data visualization is a crucial part of the project. It involves creating meaningful plots and graphs to communicate the findings effectively. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create various visualizations.

**Hypothesis Testing:** Hypothesis tests, such as the Hausman test and the Durbin-Watson test, are performed to assess the statistical significance of relationships within the data.

**Interpretation:** The project includes interpretations of various statistical tests and visualizations. Interpretations are provided both in English and French.

**Conclusion:** The project's conclusion summarizes the key findings and insights obtained from the analysis of meteorological data.
